                <p>Coffee traces its origin to a genus of plants known as Coffea. Within the genus there are
                    over 500 genera and 6,000 species of tropical trees and shrubs. Experts estimate that there
                    are anywhere from 25 to 100 species of coffee plants. In the commercial coffee industry,
                    there are two important coffee species — Arabica and Robusta.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee
                    forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There legend says the goat herder Kaldi first
                    discovered the potential of these beloved beans. The story goes that Kaldi
                    discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,
                    his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with
                    the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer.
                    The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of
                    the energizing berries began to spread.
                    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which
                    would bring these beans across the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By the 15th century, coffee was
                    being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia,
                    Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.
                    Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses — called qahveh
                    khaneh — which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee
                    houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity.

                <h3 class="uppercase">How to Brew Coffee</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Coffee is personal - the right way to make it is how you like it best. Make sure that your tools
                    — from bean grinders and filters to coffee makers— are thoroughly cleaned after each use. Rinse
                    with clear, hot water (or wipe down thoroughly), and dry with an absorbent towel. It’s important
                    to check that no grounds have been left to collect and that there’s no build-up of coffee oil
                    (caffeol), which can make future cups of coffee taste bitter and rancid.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Your beans’ greatest enemies are air, moisture, heat, and light.
                    To preserve your beans’ fresh roasted flavor as long as possible, store them in an
                    opaque, air-tight container at room temperature. Coffee beans can be beautiful, but
                    avoid clear canisters which will allow light to compromise the taste of your coffee. </p>
                <p> Keep your beans in a dark and cool location. A cabinet near the oven is often too warm, and so
                    is a spot on the kitchen counter that gets strong afternoon sun. </p>
