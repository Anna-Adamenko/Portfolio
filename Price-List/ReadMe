The Main Task was to create a price list for a fictitious restaurant chain. The price list should look appealing and stylish and use different CSS concepts.  
   
•	Used an HTML table to structure the price list.  
•	Used pseudo classes such as `:hover` and pseudo elements such as `::before` or `::after` to add interactive effects or additional design elements.   
•	Experimented with transform statements such as `rotate`, `scale` or `translate` to animate or style parts of the price list in creative ways. 
•	Created an order form.
