The Main Task was to create a personalized online "business card" or a mini-portfolio website.   

The website should have:   
•	information about yourself, e.g. name, picture, contact details and a short self-introduction. 
•	a contact form.  
•	a simple navigation with links to different sections of the page.  
•	HTML tags, which are used semantically correctly.
